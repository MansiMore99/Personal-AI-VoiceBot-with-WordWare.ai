Build a Personal AI VoiceBot in just a few minutes with WordWare.ai 🤖🎤

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For text-to-speech tasks, you might use LLMs like Llama, Claude, or, for example, the latest version of Gemini. Then we have the step where you have to configure the audio processing, create an app page, and deploy it. 🚀 Pro developers might get this done in a day, it is going to be a real learning process for beginners. Maybe two days? or even a week in order to fine-tune all these details? Hard to say.⏳

Now, imagine an AI tool that is a combination of proper data handling, LLM integration, text-to-speech configuration, and front-end deployment, all in one place. 🌟

Have you heard of Wordware.ai? 🚀

I talked about wordware_ai-building AI agents in my previous blogs and even in my demo presentations at hack night. And here I’m back with one more project: a Personal voice bot. This leads to an end-to-end conversational AI system that can accept spoken queries, make contextual responses, and even ask its users questions in a natural-sounding voice. 💬

This is my second time working on an AI voicebot project before it was with Assembly.ai, I did coding from scratch using its API, and it was really a good learning experience!!! 🔧💡This time with wordware.ai, I did not even use any extra features. It’s a one-stop solution that integrates LLMs, ElevenLabs API for text-to-speech, and app page deployment seamlessly. 🛠️✨

Beginner or pro, you can set this up in no time. Trust me, even if you’re new to this, you’ll have your VoiceBot up and running in just half an hour.⏱️💨
